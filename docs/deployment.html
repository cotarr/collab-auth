          <li>
            Review the code - No formal code review has been performed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Test before use - Testing was limited to general debugging during coding.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use &quot;npm outdated&quot; and &quot;npm audit&quot to check to package dependencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Run the instance of node.js as a non-privledged user.
          </li>
          <li>
            Require TLS 1.2 or greater for encryption to protect submitted credentials.
          </li>
          <li>
            Protect postgresql port from direct internet access using a firewall such as iptables.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use unix enviornment variables for credentials.
            When using a &quot;.env&quot; file remove public access file permissions.

        <div class="section-title">Install Repository</div>
        <p>
          This will assume you are have experience and are comfortable deploying
          express/nodejs servers in a command line shell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create a dedicated non-privileged user. Login as the non-privledged user.
          Open a command line terminal in the user's home directory or other
          directory where the repository will be installed.
          Clone the collab-auth repository and install the npm package dependencies.
          The &quot;ci&quot clean install option will remove previous packages before install.
          An environment variable NODE_ENV=production is required.
          &quot;export NODE_ENV=production&quot; may be added to the .bashrc script
          for the non-privledged user.

        <div class="section-title">Configuration Variables</div>
        <p>
          Program default configuration is stored in the &quot;server/config/index.js&quot;
          Configuration parameters can be overridden using unix environment variables.
          The configuration file will load the npm dotenv package in order to support
          an optional &quot;.env&quot file in the base folder of the repository.
          Boolean values should be set as environment variable lower case string values
          &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.
          Configuration items discussed in the following sections may be modified in
          either the configuration file or in the environment variables.
        </p>
        <div class="section-title">Server TCP Listening Port</div>
        <p>
          The default server port is TCP port 3500. In Debian 10 and node 14,
          the server will accept connection using IPV4 and IPV6 on all interfaces.
          The configured port number will be printed to console.log on program start.
          Use the following environment variable assignment to configure a custom port number.
        </p>
<pre class="pre-div">
SERVER_PORT=3500
</pre>
        <div class="section-title">Firewall Configuration</div>
        <p>
          Firewall filter rules can be quite complex and therefore beyond the scope
          of these instructions. However, at minimum, one port must be opened to
          allowing incoming TCP connections to the authorization server port.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you intend to include rate limiting rules at the firewall, the authorization
          server will need to accommodate access_token validation requests from resource servers,
          such as a REST API, that may occur as users navigate web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assuming you will be using PostgreSQL database locally, the PostgreSQL
          ports must also be protected from external internet access (see below).
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-privledged unix accounts do not have access to reserved port 443 to use
          HTTPS connections for TLS. There are several ways for a non-privledged user to
          access port 443 including reverse proxy, docker container, or firewall rules
          to exchange port numbers at the network level.
        </p>
        <p>
          When this was deployed for personal use as a learning exercise,
          the ports were switched using the following iptables rules.
          These rules must be temporarily disabled and replaced with standard port 443 INPUT rules
          in order to use Lets Encrypt certbot renew.
          Caution: You should not try something like this unless you have reviewed other rules
          in your firewall to make sure there are no conflicts that could block other
          connections such as SSH on port 22.
        </p>

<pre class="pre-div">
# Allow access to port 443 for oauth server

</pre>

        <div class="section-title">Domain Name Configuration</div>
        <p>
          To function properly on the internet, a fully qualified domain name must be used.
          It is required that the full domain name of the authorization server be different
          from any of the web servers or resource server that use the authorization server.
          This would avoid overlap of any cookies related to the authorization server domain name.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are familiar with running express/nodejs servers, then you are familiar with
          this process of registering a unique domain name and creating DNS A and AAAA
          records for the domain name using the IP address of the authorization server.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authorization server will need to know it's full URL starting with the https:// protocol.
          It will also need to know the full hostname of the sever without the https:// protocol.
          If there is a non-standard port number, it should be appended to both as shown below.
          Do not append 443 when using the standard port.
          This refers to the internet visible port, which may be different from the server
          listen port if they were changed by the firewall or reverse proxy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example using standard 443 port with TLS.
        </p>

<pre class="pre-div">
SITE_AUTH_URL=https://auth.example.com
SITE_OWN_HOST=auth.example.com
</pre>
        <p>Or, with non-standard ports:</p>
<pre class="pre-div">
SITE_AUTH_URL=https://auth.example.com:3500
SITE_OWN_HOST=auth.example.com:3500
</pre>

        <div class="section-title">Virtual Host Configuration</div>
        <p>
          This is optional. By default the vhost configuration is set to &quot;*&quot;
          which will disable hostname checking. If a vhost domain name is configured, any http
          request not matching the intended hostname will return a 404 Not Found response.
          This is not intended to allow multiple vhosts, but rather it is intended to
          reduce attack surface by blocking requests that are addressed to the server
          numeric IP address and only permitting requests to the servers domain name.
          The port number is not included.
        </p>
<pre class="pre-div">
SITE_VHOST=auth.example.com
</pre>
        <div class="section-title">TLS Configuration</div>
        <p>
          When deployed for use on the internet, valid domain certificates
          should be used for encryption of https requests to the server and
          verification of the hostname. Use of TLS is critical to protecting
          passwords and access_tokens in transit on the internet.
          Generation of TLS certificates for a domain name is beyond the scope of this
          document.
        </p>
        <p>
          When this was deployed as as a learning exercise, the Lets Encrypt certbot
          was used to generate TLS certificates.
          In this case, there was an issue because the non-privileged user account
          did not have access to the /etc/letsencrypt system folder.
          This was solved by using a bash script to copy the Lets Encrypt TLS certificates
          to the non-privileged user folder and set file permissions.
          Obviously, there are other ways to address this.
          The full chain file was used to include the CA certificates.
        </p>
        <p>
          TLS is enabled by setting &quot;SERVER_TLS&quot; to the string value &quot;true&quot;
          as shown below. By default, the minimum TLS version is set to TLS 1.2 in
          the bin/www file, which seemed reasonable considering this is an authorization server.
        </p>
        <p>
          The express/node.js web server will read TLS certificates at startup
          using configuration settings. The following can be set using
          Unix environment variables or including in a .env file.
          A relative path can be used. Edit the filenames as needed.
        </p>

<pre class="pre-div">
SERVER_TLS_KEY=/home/someuser/tls/auth_privkey.pem
SERVER_TLS_CERT=/home/someuser/tls/auth_fullchain.pem
SERVER_TLS=true
</pre>

        <div class="section-title">Token Certificates</div>

        <p>
          Openssl is used as a command line tool to generate a pair of files containing the RSA keys.
          The RSA private key is used to add a digital signature to a new token using the "RS256" algoithm.
          The RSA public key is used to verify the signature whe then token is decoded.
          Although the "certifiacte.pem" file is a standard self signed SSL/TLS web certificate,
          only the RSA Public-Key within the certificate appears to be relevant.
          The certificate attributes for "Validity Not After:..." and "Subject: CN..."
          appear to be ignored. The presence of an expired TLS certificate expiration date
          does not appear to generate any errors when decoding the JWT token.
          Therefore, these files can be considered as non-expiring credentials and 
          the certificate validity dates, which default to 30 days, are ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of this program, each JWT token will have it's own unique expiration 
          within the digitally signed token payload, so ignoring the alternate 
          certificate date this does not appear to an issue.         
        </p>
        <p>
          The following commands can be used to generate the RSA keys.          
        </p>

        <pre class="pre-div">
cd data/token-certs/

        <div class="section-title">PostgreSQL User Database</div>
        <p>
          By default, when operating in the development environment,
          the database is emulated using data storage in RAM variables.
          This is not suitable for deployment in a production enviornment 
          because passwords and client secrets are stored in plain text, and 
          all account edits will be lost each time the program is stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
          For deployment to production, configuration options enable use of a PostgreSQL database
          for storage of access tokens, refresh tokens, user accounts and client accounts.
          When the database option is enabled, user passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
          Client secrets are encrypted using crypto-js/aes for storage in the database.
          Client secrets may be visible in plain text using the editor in the administration page
          if this is enabled in the configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This program was developed using PostgreSQL version 11.</li>

          <li>It is assumed you are familiar with installation of PostgreSQL.</li>
          <li>Postgresql access restrictions have been configured in the pg_hba.conf file.</li>
          <li>Dedicated postgresql user account and password have been created.</li>
          <li>The postgresql UUID extension has been installed for the user account.</li>
          <li>Database named &quot;collabauth&quot; created with ownership by the dedicated postgres user account</li>
          <li>The database is running locally and the connection
            will use localhost 127.0.0.1 without TLS encryption.</li>
          <li>The firewall must protect the PostgreSQL port from external internet connections.</li>
          <li>The npm package "pg" is used as a PostgreSQL client.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The pg client will use the following environment variables
          to connect to the database at startup. Use of a .env file is supported by dotenv.
        </p>
<pre class="pre-div">

          Storage of program data requires 4 tables.
          These tables can be created using the database command line client &quot;psql&quot.
          The file: &quot;SQL-tools/create-oauth-tables.sql&quot; includes SQL query utility commands.
          These can by copy/paste directly into the psql client to better observe
          the result and check for errors.

          A javascript utility located at &quot;SQL-tools/create-postgres-admin-user.js&quot;
          can be used to create the an initial admin user account.
          It is then possible to use the admin panel at "/panel/menu"
          to login as the "admin" user and create any additional user or
          client accounts that may be needed.
          When run from the command line terminal, this will prompt
          for input: User number (default=1000), Username (default=&quot;admin&quot;),
          Name (default=&quot;Admin Account&quot;), and Password.
          Further instructions can be found in the
          <a href="admin.html">Admin Editor</a> section.
          The utility should be run from base folder of repository folder using:

<pre class="pre-div">

</pre>


        <div class="section-title">Session database storage</div>
        <p>
          The default development configuration uses the npm package "memorystore"
          to store session information from express-session. Memorystore is a
          memory safe implementation of RAM memory storage of HTTP sessions.
          Each time the server is restarted, previous session data is lost,
          so users must login to the authorization server each time the collab-auth server is restarted.
          This will not impact collab-frontend web server, or other web servers, as they have their own cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optionally, the npm package "connect-pg-simple" can be used to
          store session data in a PostgreSQL database. This would permit cookies to remain 
          persistent across restarts of the collab-auth authorization server.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Some online discussion claim using PostgreSQL for session storage may be slow 
          compared to RAM memory cached alternatives like Redis or memorystore.
          However, with collab-auth, the cookie and session storage are only relevant 
          during interactive browser calls like password entry or using the admin panel.
          This occurs infrequently, therefore postgresql seems reasonable 
          for session storage where persistence is needed. 
          Since memorystore includes pruning of obsolete records, either postgresql or memorystore 
          options should be acceptable for session storage when used with 
          limited deployments, like a home network.
        </p>
        <p>
          Session storage will use the same PostgreSQL database that was used previously
          to store user and client accounts.
          It is assumed the database has been created and the environment variables have been
          configured to allow the pg client to connect at program startup (see instructions above).
        </p>
        <p>
          One table needs to be created for storage of session data. There is a SQL script
          located at &quot;SQL-tools/create-session-table.sql&quot; that contains SQL query commands
          to create the required database table. The contents can be copy/pasted into the
          psql terminal database client.

          After the table has been created, PostgreSQL database storage is enabled using
          the following environment variable.
          If this is not defined or not contain the string value "true" then
          the program will revert back to memorystore.

        <div class="section-title">Security.txt Contacts</div>
        <p>
          The authorization server supports use of a security.txt file as
          described at <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">https://securitytxt.org/</a>.
          The specification defines a URL route at &quot;.well-known/security.txt&quot;
          that is intended to provide a method to notify the owner of the server in the
          event that a security issue is detected. This is disabled by default.
          To enable the security.txt notification, set the following environment variables.
          Remember to replace the contact with your contact.
          The time must be in standard unix format typically 1 year ahead.
          (Suggested bash command: &quot;date --date='1 year' --iso-8601=seconds&quot;)

        <p>
          There is a common security suggestion that states:
          If you are not using something on a server, remove it.
          It decreases the attack surface should a vulnerability be found in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          This oauth2orize library supports Oauth 2.0 grant types:
          code grant, client grant, password grant, implicit grant, and refresh token grant.
          In the event that some grant types are not required for your use case, each grant type
          may be disabled individually in the configuration. This will prevent the oauth2orize server
          from loading the associated callback. Requests would be treated as an error for
          unsupported grant type. In addition, the input validation checker would
          block the request should the request parameters contain an improper grant_type parameter.
          The boolean value should be an environment variable string &quottrue&quot.
          By default all grant type are enabled (Disabled false).
          This is optional. Disable as needed.
          It is necessary to restart the nodejs server after making changes.

          Likewise, the authorization server includes an administration page that can be used
          to add, edit, or delete user account records and client account records. Access to the
          admin editor requires a user account to have scope &quot;auth.admin&quot;
          listed as a user role.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user database does not require frequent changes, the administration page found at
          &quot;/panel/menu&quot may be disabled in the configuration.
          Requests to &quot;/panel/menu&quot; will return 404 Not Found.

          When using the PostreSQL database option, client secrets are encrypted before storage
          in the database using crypto-js/aes. During deployment on a personal server and
          home network, numerous Raspberry Pi IOT devices were configured to use access_tokens.
          It was useful to have the capability to view existing client secrets in plain text.
          By default, the client edit form will present an empty input element
          for the client secret. Entry of a new client secret will replace the previous client
          secret. As a configuration option the visibility of the client secret may be enabled
          in the configuration and the server restarted.

        <div class="section-title">Cookie/Session Configuration</div>
        <p>
          By default, browser cookies for the collab-auth authorization server
          are created as session cookies. The cookie will not be issued an 
          expiration date, but remain valid until the browser is closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Setting SESSION_NOT_SESSION_COOKIE=true will instruct the server to 
          add a cookie expiration time as specified in SESSION_EXPIRE_SEC.
          Optionally, this can become a rolling cookie by setting 
          SESSION_SET_ROLLING_COOKIE=true so a new cookie expiration date 
          is issued with each browser interaction.
        </p>

        <div class="section-title">Starting the Server</div>
        <p>
          Ideally the server should be run in the background using the non-privledged account.
          This can easily be done using a user crontab and shell script.
          In it's current form, collab-auth is not capable to run as a unix service using systemd.
          The following commands are examples of server startup to run in the
          foreground of the non-privileged user command line terminal.
        </p>
<pre class="pre-div">
export NODE_ENV=production
npm start
</pre>
        <p>Or equivalently:</p>
<pre class="pre-div">
export NODE_ENV=production
node bin/www
</pre>
        <p>
          While in production mode (NODE_ENV=production) the log output can
          be redirected to the terminal by running the server in the foreground
          with the following command. (NODE_DEBUG_LOG variable not supported in .env file.)
        </p>
<pre class="pre-div">
export NODE_ENV=production
NODE_DEBUG_LOG=1 npm start
</pre>

        <p>
          When the server has successfully started, the following
          startup information will be logged to logs/node.log.

      <div class="section-title">Testing comments</div>
      <p>
        The authorization server includes some additional middleware. 
        <ul>
          <li>express-validator - input syntax validation (422 Unprocessable Entity)</li>
          <li>csurf - cross-site protection, csurf tokens (403 Forbidden)</li>
          <li>express-rate-limit - brute force mitigation (429 Too many requests)</li>
        </ul>
        In most cases, this mitigation middleware is applied before a submission reaches
        the core oauthorize server and it's customized callback functions.
        The addition of secondary middleware protections can make it difficult to test oauth code.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider a test to challenge a user password form submission 
        for a case of missing password data. What would happend if the oauthorize custom 
        callback function for user database lookup and password hash comparrison actually had 
        a coding error that failed to reject submissions with missing password data?
        This coding error could be overlooked because the test expected an error, but 
        the expected error may have been generated by input validation or rate limit 
        and viewed as a successful test without actually challenging the password lookup.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to approach testing is to disable the different middleware and test independently.
        In order to manage this, the chained node/express middleware functions 
        are written with one middleware per line to allow 
        each middleware to be disabled for testing by prefixing the line with 
        javascript // comment caracters.
        Below is an example of the oauth 2.0 decision dialog route showing 
        the input validation and scrf protection middlewares. The core oauth2 function 
        is server.decision(), shown here following the other middleware.
      </p>
<pre class="pre-div">
exports.decision = [
  login.ensureLoggedIn(),
  inputValidation.dialogAuthDecision,
  csrfProtection,
  server.decision(),
  server.authorizationErrorHandler(),
  server.errorHandler()
];
</pre>
        <p>
          These critical routes with concurrent middleware should only appear in 
          the following 3 files.
          <ul>
            <li>admin-panel.js</li>
            <li>oauth2.js</li>
            <li>site.js</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a side note, an argument can be made that the oauthorize library 
          is robustly coded and has a good track record. 
          Therefore the addition of csrf protection and input validation 
          may not be necessary for the oauth routes. On the other hand, 
          they may needlessly increase the attack surface and make things worse. 
          However, they are likely needed for the admin panel account editor 
          as it is a simple form editor.

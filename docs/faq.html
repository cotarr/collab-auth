              Q: What testing has been performed?

            <p>
              A: During coding, functions were debugged manually, primarily using postman.
              The postman collections were extracted and included in the repository.
              The primary focus was on grant type: authorizaton code grant and client credentials grant. 
              Less attention was spent on implicit grant and password grant.
              Unused grant types can be disabled in the configuration.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>No automated tests included.</li>
              <li>No formal testing has been performed.</li>

              Q: Why add csrf tokens?
            </p>
            <p>
              A: Cross Site Request Forgery is generally a security issue where the cookie
              for one web site is used to make a valid data submission to different web site
              when both pages are using the same web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              Csrf protection is the addition of a random csrf token to the html code
              of a web page html file by the web server before sending the file to the browser.
              The csrf token can be submitted to the web server with future API requests 
              to reduce the risk of cross-site data submissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Csrf protection was primarily added to protect the admin editor &lt;form&gt;
              elements during critical security actions like creating a new user based on 
              input data entered into the form.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since it was available, csrf proection was added to the oauth login form, the 
              password change form, and the oauth client trust decision form.
              This may not be necessary, because the trust decision already includes a random 
              oauthorize transaction code, and both login and password forms require 
              a previously known valid user passwords. Thus, except for the admin editor, 
              adding csrf protection to the oauth forms may be adding complexity 
              and increasing the attack surface without a security benefit.
              It's currently installed, but may be removed in the future.

            <p>
              Q: Why add express-validator?
            </p>
            <p>
              Express-validator is an express/node middleware that can provide syntax validation
              to user data submission before action by additional request handlers. Syntax 
              errors in user input will generate a status 422 Unprocessable Entity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The primary purpose was to sanitize user input for the admin editor.
              This is to prevent unsafe command characters from being included in 
              user names, client names, or other string data stored in the database or 
              potentially displayed in a web browser.

          <tr><td><a name="input-val-issues">
            <p>
              Q: Can input validation break oauth?
            </p>
            <p>
              A: Possibly (see previous question). 
            </p>
            <p>
              Input validation was added to the project to protect the admin editor when 
              creating or editing user accounts. Since it was available, it was added to 
              some of the oauth 2.0 routes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The oauthorize server (library) appears to have it's own internal input validaiton.
              The oauthorize npm repository has large user base and good history.
              Adding input validation middleware infront of the oauthorize server may be of limited benefit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Possible issues:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Prevent automated tests from reaching oauthorize and it's custom callback functions.</li>
              <li>Different grant types require complex syntax rules</li>
              <li>Various oauth data may be optional</li>
              <li>Some oauth data can appear in either body, header, or query parameter</li>
              <li>Possible error responses that are not RFC compliant with Oauth 2.0</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It is currently installed on oauth routes, but with limited checks.
              The input validation includes a custom error handler to 
              generate the "WWW-Authenticate" header in oauth error responses.
              In the future it may be adjusted or removed entirely from 
              oauth routes.

          <tr><td><a name="faq-refresh-tokens">
            <p>
              Q: Are refresh tokens supported?<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              A: Yes. Refresh tokens can be demonstrated in the development enviornment
              using postman. The collection &quot;collab-auth (code grant)&quot;
              can be run to obtain an access_token and refresh_token which are
              stored in postman variables.
              A second collection &quot;collab-auth (misc calls)&quot; contains a single
              test called &quot;POST /oauth/token (refresh)&quot; that will retrieve
              the refresh_token from postman variables and exchange the refresh_token
              for a replacement access_token.
            </p>
            <p>
              The collab-frontend demonstration web server supports the use of
              refresh_tokens. The demo page allows inspection of the token
              meta-data. After access_token expiration, the refresh_token is used
              to automatically obtain a replacement access_token.
              This can be seen by examining the token meta-data on the web page.
              The property &quot;grant_type&quot; will change 
              from &quot;authorization_code&quot; to &quot;refresh_token&quot;

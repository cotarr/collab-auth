          Admin Editor
        </div>
        <p>
          Considering the limited use case for this oauth2 server would involve
          use with a personal web server and access to home network IOT devices
          for a limited number of friends or family,
          it was not necessary to build an administration API. To perform
          management of user accounts, a simple form editor was incorporated
          directly in to the authorization server.
          Comprehensive user data including
          contact information was not included in the user records over privacy considerations.
          Access to the admin editor requires a user account with
          role &quot;user.admin&quot;. The Admin Editor can be opened
          on the authorization server at the following path:
        </p>
<pre class="pre-div">
/panel/menu
</pre>
        <p>
          In the case where the authorization server is operating in
          a development environment in demonstration mode, the user
          database is emulated using RAM memory variables. The Admin Editor
          will display a warning indicating this as shown in the screen capture below.
          In this mode, editing of accounts will function, but any
          edit of accounts will be lost when the server is shut down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternately, when the server is configured to use a PostgreSQL database,
          the user account and client account records are stored in PostgreSQL database tables.

        <p>
          In the above section, user accounts are used to delegate permissions to a person.
          Client accounts are used to delegate permissions to a server or other network resource.
          For example, during login, a user will present his username and password to get an
          authorization code. The web server then will use the clientId and clientSecret to exchange
          the authorization code for an access token. The server client account would require some
          type of permission to request tokens, in addition to permissions of the user account.
          Client accounts for a REST API would need permission to validate access tokens using the
          authorization server API, but a REST API may be restricted from requesting new access tokens.

          Scope and Role
        </div>
        <p>
          When researching Oauth 2.0 to write this project, the concept of token scope
          was an opaque concept in most documentation. A typical tutorial would
          claim that scope is implementation dependent and the subject of scope would be
          omitted entirely from a tutorial.
        </p>
        <p>
          The implementation of scope permissions in this project is unique to
          this project and does not follow a known standard. The specific scope definitions
          used here have evolved over the course of project. The general goal was to
          service a home network with web API in Raspberry Pi IOT devices visible through a
          personal web page where the user base would be a limited set of family or friends.

          There are 3 different ways scope permissions are used with this authorization server.
        </p>

        <div class="section-title">1 - Account Administration Permission</div>
        <p>
          This refers only to a user account for direct access to
          the authorization server web pages. Any user who is assigned
          the role &quot;user.password&quot; will permit a user to access to the
          /changepassword route on the authorization server.
          The user role &quot;user.admin&quot will permit a user access to
          the admin editor on the /panel/menu route.
          This would grant full access to modify all account records.
          If user.password or user.admin were to appear in a client account or
          in an access token it would be ignored.
        </p>
        <div class="section-title">2 - Oauth2 API Access Permission</div>
        <p>
          This refers only to web servers or other network hardware devices.
          Servers and network devices can be configured to use a client account
          where the clientId and clientSecret are used as credentials to
          obtain access to the /oauth route on the authorization server.
        </p>
        <p>
          A web server that has a client account with allowedScope
          &quot;auth.token&quot; would have
          permission to request new access tokens where the tokens are
          associated with an authenticated user account. For example, a web
          server would require access to the /oauth/token route in order to
          exchange an authorization code for a user access_token. The web
          server can then store the user's access_token tied to the
          user web browser's cookie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data resources, such as a REST API database,
          would use the allowedScope value of &quot;auth.info&quot; to
          allow access to the  /oauth/introspect route to validate
          the access_token and retrieve the token meta-data.
          The REST API would use the results to allow access to data or deny the request.
          This is a read only scope. Therefore a network resource using
          a client account with allowedScope auth.info would not be able to
          request new access tokens.
        </p>
        <p>
          A third allowedScope value of &quot;auth.client&quot; can be
          used to request access_tokens independent of any user account.
          This would apply to data collection devices that require
          permission to write data to a database API.
          Some automated machine devices operate continuously.
          The use of a user login and password is impractical for security
          reasons, because each of multiple devices would need to store the user's password.
          OAuth2 allows IOT devices operate under their own authority without a user.
          Oauth2 supports a token grant type called &quot;client grant&quot; grant.
          This type of token is sometimes called a machine token, as opposed to a user token.
          Note that two set of credentials are required to issue user access_tokens,
          user password and client secret. When using auth.client with client grant,
          only one credential is needed to request tokens.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authorization server will ignore scope values of auth.info,
          auth.token, or auth.client should they be present in a user role or access_token.
        </p>

        <div class="section-title">3 - External Resource Permission Scopes</div>
        <p>
          Resource permissions are complex because resource permissions must
          accommodate an arbitrary number of administrator configured scope values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access tokens are used to restrict access to an external resource server.
          Scope values provide a granular method further restrict access assigned
          to a given access token in a way that can be unique to a specific user.
          Therefore, the authorization server assigns scope to an access_token
          with knowledge of the user account permission values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Independently, an external resource server must make a decision to
          allow access to data or reject requests.
          Resource servers parse token scope and make a decision based on internal
          scope requirements configured in each resource server.
          Resource servers can maintain their own independent list of configurable scopes.
          These scope lists may be hardcoded into an API.
          Therefore scopes must be configured in both the
          user accounts and the data resource servers. This section refers only to the
          scopes associated with access_tokens generated by the authorization server.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the authorization server assigns a list of scope values to an
          access_token, the token scope is the intersection of scope from 3 sources.
        </p>
        <div><img src="images/token-scope.png" alt="Scope intersection diagram" width="391" height="263" ></div>
        <p>
          For example consider the case of a database API. For the sake of discussion,
          assume the database API is capable of 4 functions to create, read, write, and delete records.
          This could be represented by 4 arbitrary scope values, &quot;data.create&quot;,
          &quot;data.write&quot;, &quot;data.read&quot;, and &quot;data.delete&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, a frontend web server is created. It uses the authorization server
          to handle user login and stores the user access_tokens in the web server.
          The web server also has software to process API requests from the browser with
          internal logic to handle browser API requests and utilize various external data API.
          For this example, the web server software will have the capability for all 4
          functions: create, read, write, and delete. Since the software has all 4 functions,
          when the web server requests tokens, the token request that is
          sent to the authorization server /dialog/authorize route would include
          a query parameter for scope.
          Since the software of the web server is capable of all 4 functions, all 4
          possible functions are included in token request scope parameter. The token request would
          look something similar to this example.
          The scope values are separated ascii space characters, but for clarity
          this example is not escaped and the line is wrapped.
        </p>
<pre class="pre-div">
/dialog/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/login/callback&
     scope=data.create data.read data.write data.delete&client_id=abc123
</pre>
        <p>
          Next, consider the client account which is assigned to the web server
          to allow access to the authorization server for the purpose of obtaining
          new access tokens. The client account has a list of allowedScope.
          For this example, we will restrict any server using this client
          account to disable capability to delete records. Only create, read and write
          are allowed. As described above, the additional scope value of auth.token
          is required to permit the web server to access the /oauth/token API.
          Note: data.detete is not present.
          The web server client allowedScope would look something like this:
        </p>
<pre class="pre-div">
{
  "allowedScope: [
    "data.create",
    "data.read",
    "data.write",
    "auth.token"
  ]
}
</pre>
        <p>
          Now consider the user account. Perhaps we don't trust this user and therefore
          the user is restricted to read only access to the database. The scope value listed
          in the user's role would be data.read. Note user.password is included so the
          user would have capability to change passwords as described above.
        </p>
<pre class="pre-div">
{
  "role": [
    "data.read",
    "user.password"
  ]
}
</pre>
          Next the authorization server creates a new access token for the user.
          It will contain the intersection all 3 scope sources.
          The only value appearing in all three is &quot;data.read&quot;.
          Therefore the token would include the following scope property inherent to the
          token meta-data stored in the authorization server.
        </p>
<pre class="pre-div">
{
  "scope": [
    "data.read"
  ]
}
</pre>
        <p>
          Now consider any external data resource server that receives an API request
          where a valid access_token in included as a bearer token in the authorization header.
          The resource server will send the token to the authorization server for validation.
          The resource server will first check that the token was valid.
          Having validated the token, it will extract the scope and compare the token
          scope value against configured scope values for each route.
          The data request will be accepted or denied.
        </p>

        <div class="section-title">Comments</div>
        <p>
          Token requests are typically submitted as a browser 302 redirect.
          Therefore the contents of the scope query parameter could be altered by
          a user. Use of a intersection with client allowedScope and user role
          will prevent extraneous scope values being introduced by a user.
